- Implement OpenAPI definitions
- Golang process on master node to call the rabbitMQ endpoints, fetch data and update CRDS
- Create Rancher extensions to handle sensors CRDs
- Create a manifest.yaml file for each supported sensors (svg, description, link to homepage)
- Create a CRD for each sensor
- Create a CRD for each raspberry module
- Bind raspberry CRD to each installed sensor CRD
- Sensor's CRDS should be updated ONLY by controller pod
- Rancher UI should display
  - sensor CRD
  - raspberry CRD
- Each sensor (device) should have a docker image to produce an executable file and should specify a compatibility list with modules (raspberry version)
- The module's docker image for each module's type (Raspberry's version) should be generic
  - It should connect to RabbitMQ bus and call the device executable given the action received from controller on RabbitMQ messages
  - RabbitMQ messages should specify the action and the expected result (format)
  - It should call the device executable depending on API interface defined in the settings file
- GitHub CI should build the executable file using the docker image of the device
  - Defining Device's builder docker image and interface is demanded to the developer
  - The device's API should be defined in the settings file
- Define a builder kit for devices
  - The device <-> rpc-server interface should use OpenAPI definition to build a skeleton and call the executable built in devices docker images.
